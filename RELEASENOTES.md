## [0.1.3] - 2023-07-27

### Changed
- update of the `ot_simple_connector` version to 0.1.12

### Fixed
- parsing inPort values when not surrounded by whitespaces. Example: `(inPort1 + inPort2 + inPort3) / 100` evaluated to `(inPort1 + 'DataNode_1.value' + inPort3) / 100`.
- parsing float values as float values, not strings. Example: `eval 'DataNode_1.value' = '0.6'` did not evaluate.

- Tests.
- Graph calculation is only through the `POST` method to `/dtcd_simple_math_core/v1/graph/` url with `swt_name` and `graph` parameters required.
- SWT may be read only through the `GET` method to `/dtcd_simple_math_core/v1/swt/` url with `swt_name` parameter required.
- Import data through `SWT` and `SWT Export` property request type without any custom actions or buttons, from properties of the nodes from a different graph if source graph has the same `_t` tick value as the latest tick of target graph.
- Import data through ports of the nodes.
- Parsing of the `email` string in the `expression` of the property of the noe fixed.
